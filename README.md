Console application that allows you to change theme settings in Windows 10 even if the settings are restricted. Based on what I've seen, this should also work on Windows 11 but I haven't tested it.
Needs to be run as administrator to make changes to the registry.

# Features:
- Toggle system and application dark themes individually
- Toggle transparency
- Toggle setting accent color based on wallpaper colors
- Set custom color for application title bars and task bar individually
    - 24-bit hex format
	- Automatically converts RGB to BGR when needed
